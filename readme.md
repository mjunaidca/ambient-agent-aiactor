# Ambient AI Actor: Challenge to create AgentCore Core Capabilities

The is self challenge in progress.

üéØ **End Goal**: A üîå Plug-and-Play runtime compatible with any agent type, from LLMs (OpenAI, LangGraph) to workflows (Temporal, Dapr Workflows).

üîÅ **Analogy**: The `BaseActor` is a Dapr Virtual Actor‚Äîa fully featured AI agent runtime equipped with:

- Reactive and proactive behaviors
- Event-driven processing   - Event-driven processing
- Direct method handling
- Internal and external system integration
- Robust memory
- Inherent resiliency
- Planning capabilities
- Task scheduling with reminders and timers

## Prerequisites

- Completed `01_actor_foundation` setup.
- Python 3.12+, Dapr CLI, Tilt, and Rancher Desktop.

## Clone and Run the Code

Clone the `01_actor_foundation` repo or continue from your existing setup:
```bash
tilt up
```

Open:
- Tilt UI: `http://localhost:1035`
- Dapr Dashboard: `http://localhost:8080`
- DACA Actor Interface: `http://localhost:30080/docs`
- Metrics Tracing Interface: `http://localhost:9090`
- Jaeger UI Interface: `http://localhost:16686`

## Detailed Steps of the Challenge:
Step 1: Foundation Setup (Completed)
Step 2: Base Actor Interface (Completed)
Step 3: Base Actor Skeleton (Completed)
Step 4: Advanced Config (In Progress)
Step 5: Bindings, PubSub (In Progress)

## Next Steps / In Progress

With the `BaseActor` foundation firmly in place, the project will now focus on expanding its capabilities and building out the agentic ecosystem:

1.  **Developing Specialized Actors**:
    *   Implement concrete actor types that inherit from `BaseActor`. Examples include:
        *   `ChatActor`: For managing conversational AI logic and user interactions.
        *   `MemoryActor`: For handling persistent and contextual memory for agents.
        *   `TriageAgent`: For intelligently routing tasks, messages, and information within a multi-agent system.
        *   `ToolUsingActor`: For integrating and managing external tools and APIs via MCP.
    *   Define specific interfaces, state models, and business logic for these specialized agents.
2.  **Enhancing DACA Alignment**:
    *   Further refine the integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized tool use.
    *   Implement and standardize Agent2Agent (A2A) communication patterns for interoperable agent collaboration.
    *   Explore and integrate other Dapr components (e.g., Dapr Workflows for complex orchestrations) as needed.
3.  **Real-World Application & Use Cases**:
    *   Develop example applications and proof-of-concepts (PoCs) showcasing the `BaseActor` and specialized actors in action.
    *   Target use cases like autonomous research agents, collaborative task execution systems, or sophisticated chatbots.
4.  **Testing, Scalability, and Resilience**:
    *   Conduct thorough unit, integration, and end-to-end testing for the `BaseActor` and new specialized actors.
    *   Perform load testing to validate scalability and resilience under various conditions, aiming for DACA's high-concurrency goals.
    *   Continuously monitor and improve observability using the existing Prometheus and Jaeger setup.
5.  **Comprehensive Documentation**:
    *   Provide detailed documentation for developers on how to use the `BaseActor`, create new specialized agents, and deploy the DACA Actor Runtime.
    *   Include architectural diagrams, sequence diagrams, and best practices.

This ongoing work aims to leverage the robust `BaseActor` to build a versatile and powerful multi-agent system, pushing towards the Agentia World vision where AI agents collaborate seamlessly and effectively.
