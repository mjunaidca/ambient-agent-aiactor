        What:
            Handles generic synchronous messages, commands, or queries sent to the actor.
            This is a versatile entry point for various synchronous interactions.
        Why:
            Fulfills the 'Reactive & Real-Time Processing' promise by enabling low-latency,
            versatile message handling. The actor can signal an outgoing stream via the response.
        How:
            The actor's internal logic processes the `message_data` (which should specify
            the intended action or query) in real-time, potentially updating state,
            triggering events, or initiating workflows. Supports 'Flexible Agent Engine
            Integration' by handling diverse payloads. In M6, may initiate background handoffs.

        Why:
            Fulfills state management and knowledge retrieval by enabling flexible querying,
            from simple key-value lookups (by `entry_id` in `query` dict) to potentially more
            complex semantic searches (depending on implementation). Supports 'Own your context window'.

            Stops the plan's execution, cleans up associated resources (e.g., reminders, timers),

            this actor's capabilities, supported interaction methods (potentially beyond this
            interface for specialized agents), communication endpoints, and other metadata.

            or low-confidence tasks, ensuring safer and more reliable agent operation.
        How:
            Typically publishes a review request event (containing `review_request_id`, `task_context`, etc.)
            to a dedicated HITL system or topic, or stores it for polling. `assigned_to` can route

        Why:
            Completes the 'HITL Integration' loop by allowing the agent to receive and process
            human input, enabling it to adapt, learn (potentially), or proceed with human guidance.

        Why:
            Meets 'Dapr Workflow Interaction' by enabling the actor to offload complex processes,
            keeping the actor itself responsive. Useful for addressing handoff scenarios like those
            seen in LangGraph/CrewAI, where an actor might delegate a sub-process to a workflow.
        How:
            The actor calls Dapr to start a workflow instance of type `workflow_name` (registered with Dapr),
            optionally specifying the `workflow_component_name` if not default. `workflow_input` is passed
            to the workflow, and `workflow_options` can include things like instance ID.
